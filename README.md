Repeated Code in Subroutines        July 14, 2020

As you write more code, a pattern emerges. We repeatedly use the same set of instructions.
A subroutine is deployed to reuse those snippets of code just to carry out that specific 
task. Using subroutines can increase the readability, quality, reliability, and 
maintainability of programs. It is modularization. It can be called anywhere. Once the 
subroutine is complete, it should return back to the place that called the subroutine. A
subroutine is also called a procedure, function, or a routine. The calling program is
called Caller and the subroutine called is known as Callee. The instruction that transfer
control back to the caller is known as Return.

How you write your subroutine depends on the task. It may or may not return a result. 
Usually, it receives some input arguments which it processes thereon. For example, 
finding the maximum of an array of elements might necessitate two arguments, namely:
the memory address (Pointer in C) of the array, and the number of items in the array.

The block of instructions that constitute a subroutine can be included at every point in
the main program. However, this would result in unnecessary waste of memory space. So
using subroutines increases the versatily by using only one copy of the instructions. In
software, there are many ways to "skin the cat", so to speak. To standardize writing
subroutines, the ABI(with OS) and EABI(without OS) application binary interface 
specifications suggest protocols implementing subroutines.

Calling a subroutine requires a deviation from the default sequential execution of
instructions. When a program branches to a subroutine, the processor begins execution of
the instructions that make up the subroutine and branch to the subroutine by modifying the
Program Counter (PC). In ARM, the Branch and Link instruction (BL) is used to Branch to
subroutine.

BL mySubroutine   ; Points to first line of subroutine

This instruction saves the current address of program counter (PC) in the link register
(LR) before placing the starting address of the subroutine in the program counter. When 
the subroutine has completed its task, the processor must be able to branch back (return)
to the instruction immediately following the branch instruction that invoked the
subroutine. To return from the subroutine we move the value stored in the link register
to program counter which returns the control to the next instruction from which
subroutine was called. Thus, to return from subroutine we should use the following 
instruction:

BX LR        ; Return to the instruction that called the subroutine

MOV PC, LR   ; Same as BX LR

A programmer designs subroutines in assembly considering three special issues.

1) The subroutine saves the environment by pushing registers to be used in the subroutine
   onto the stack at the beginning of the procedure. Before it branches to the other 
   non-contiguous code section, it must save the PC + 4 address to the Link Register (LR)
   so it can safely return to normal execution after it finishes the subroutine. The CPU
   will copy address of callee function to PC so it can jump execution to the callee.
   The BL instruction is 32bits/4bytes long and PC is incremented by 4 so PC + 4.
2) Second, it restores the environment by popping off the stack after encountering BX LR.
3) To facilitate sharing of code and such that C, C++, and Assembly programs can call 
   these subroutines, the ABI and EABI standard should be followed such prescribed 
   protocols of parameter passing and returning values are performed in compliance. For
   example, registers to use for passing parameters in arguments and returning values
   should be r0, r1, r2, and r3, registers r4 r8, r10, and r11 are normally used to hold
   the values of a routine's local variables, ARM and THUMB C and C++ compilers always
   use a full descending stack and it must be eight-byte aligned, to name a few.

ARM supports different branch instructions for conditional executions. Depending on the
condition, these instructions transfer the control from one part of the program to other.
Unlike Branch-and-Link (BL) instruction they do not save contents of Program counter (PC)
register to the Link Register (LR).

We can also nest subroutines. To do this, I have written an example code to demonstrate.

The C code generated the assembly listing exactly the same as the concepts presented
above. You can view it also from Debug's Disassembly window or from fromelf or objdump.

C Program:

void second_sub(){

}

void first_sub(){

    second_sub();
    
}

int main(){

    first_sub();
    
	while(1);
	
}

Assembly Snippet:
